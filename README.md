# Product Substitute Predictions

Using a mixture of numerical, categorical, and text data, determine whether two products (key and candidate) are considered substitutes. Investigated a couple of models, including KNN, random forests, and neural networks using Amazon Sagemaker. At this point, it's still a pretty basic model (haven't done too much work optimizing architecture and hyperparameters).
